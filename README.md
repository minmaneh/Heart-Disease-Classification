# Heart-Disease-Classification
REST service provides the prediction of a classification model trained to predict
the target variable for an input. The model would classify patients with heart disease based on
features in the data.
The project aims to select a set of 5 features which the model will use to make a prediction.
Multiple models are evaluated to select the best performing.
Dataset used for this project:
Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset.
The model provides prediction probability and outputs the percentage of the patient having heart disease.
